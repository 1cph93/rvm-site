== Welcome to the RVM Site Documentation

You can see the documentation live online at http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/.

== Get the Site Running Locally

If you're going to help you'll first need to get the site running locally on your machine. Start by forking the repository and cloning the fork to your machine.

== Requirements

The site requires that you have ruby 1.9.1 running in your environment. You can do this with RVM by typing the following at the command line:

rvm install 1.9.1-p378

RVM also requires the following Gems:

Compass
http://compass-style.org/

HAML (SASS is bundled with this Gem)
http://haml-lang.com/
http://sass-lang.com/

Nanoc3
http://nanoc.stoneship.org/

Rack
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_on_rack.html

Mime-type
http://rubyforge.org/projects/mime-types/

The cloned site will detect if you have these installed (except Mime-type) in your current ruby and if not it will install them in RVM for you.

== Getting it Running

To get the HAML to compile and run locally you'll need to type the following in the command line:

	nanoc3 aco
	
== Update Submission

Once you've updated the documentation push it back to github and initiate a pull request.

== Thanks

Thanks for taking the time to work on RVM.
