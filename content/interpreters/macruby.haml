  MacRuby
%p
  MacRuby is a ruby interpreter built on top of Apple's NS Framework,
  it is aimed at allowing developers to create native OSX applications using Ruby!
%p
  Please note that much of the content below was taken from
  %a{:href => "https://github.com/MacRuby/MacRuby/blob/trunk/README.rdoc"}
    the README.rdoc on github

%h2
  Latest Release
%p
  Installing the latest official release known by your RVM is the same procedure
  as for other interpreters.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm install macruby

%h2
  Head (aka 'trunk')
%p
  Installing the latest macruby development from it's repository on github is
  detailed in the following.
%p
  Please be sure that LLVM and all other requirements (see below) are met
  before running the following command.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm install macruby-head

%p
  MacRuby is a Ruby implementation based on Mac OS X technologies, such as the
  Objective-C runtime and garbage collector, the CoreFoundation framework and
  the LLVM compiler infrastructure.
%p
  It is the goal of MacRuby to enable the creation of full-fledged Mac OS X
  applications which do not sacrifice performance in order to enjoy the benefits
  of using Ruby.

%h3 Requirements

%ul
  %li
    An Intel machine. PowerPC machines are no longer supported, but may still
    work. An Intel 64-bit machine (Intel Core Duo 2) is recommended.

  %li
    Mac OS X 10.6 or later.

  %li
    LLVM ToT, compiled for both i386 and x86_64.

%h3 Compiling LLVM

%p
  LLVM is a moving target and breaks periodically. We recommend to install
  revision 106781, being sure to specify the correct C and C++ compilers through
  environment variables.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ svn co -r 106781 https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm-trunk
    $ cd llvm-trunk
    $ env UNIVERSAL=1 UNIVERSAL_ARCH="i386 x86_64" CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ ./configure --enable-bindings=none --enable-optimized --with-llvmgccdir=/tmp
    $ env UNIVERSAL=1 UNIVERSAL_ARCH="i386 x86_64" CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make
    $ sudo env UNIVERSAL=1 UNIVERSAL_ARCH="i386 x86_64" CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make install

%p
  Note that compiling LLVM can take quite a while. If you have a machine with
  multiple cores, which is quite likely, you might want to speed up the process
  by using all/more cores. However, doing this can make your machine
  unresponsive during compilation. To use multiple cores pass the `-j N'
  option, where `N' stands for the number of cores you'd like to use. So for a
  Core Duo the command would look like:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ env UNIVERSAL=1 UNIVERSAL_ARCH="i386 x86_64" CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make -j2
