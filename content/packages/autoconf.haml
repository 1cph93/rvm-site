    Autoconf
  %hr

%h2
  Quick fix
%p
  Update RVM:
  = sh_cmd "rvm get head"
  Remove all the manually installed packages:
  = sh_cmd "rvm pkg remove"
  Install the required libraries:
  = sh_cmd "rvm requirements run"
  Reinstall ruby:
  = sh_cmd "rvm reinstall 1.9.3"

%h2
  Autoconf

%p
  If your ruby (usually 1.9.2-head / trunk) fails to compile and the make error log shows
  that you do not have a current enough version of autoconf ::cough:: CentOS ::cough:: then
  you can install it into your RVM.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm pkg install autoconf

%p
  Note that autoconf will be installed to ~/.rvm/bin so be sure it is in your path.
%p
  If it is not in your path you can add it like this
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ export PATH=$rvm_path/bin:$PATH

%p
  Once autoconf has been installed, you can then (re) install your ruby
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm reinstall 1.9.2-head

%p
  In case of compilation problems try:
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      $ rvm --skip-autoreconf pkg install autoconf
