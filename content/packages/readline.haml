  Readline

  If you have an error when compiling pertaining to readline, you may need to attempt installing with the following configure option:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ rvm package install readline
    ∴ rvm remove 1.9.2
    ∴ rvm install 1.9.2 -C --with-readline-dir=$rvm_path/usr
%p
  Note that this error occurs most often when having a macports installed readline on your system.
  The next most often is when the readline development headers are not available at all. The above
  commands solve this by having rvm compile a local version inside ~/.rvm/usr and then telling the ruby
  install to use it.
