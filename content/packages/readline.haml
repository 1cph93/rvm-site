  If you have an error when compiling pertaining to readline, you may need to attempt installing with the procedure defined below.
%p
  NOTE: Before you follow the procedure below please be sure to verify that you
  have installed any dependencies for the ruby you are installing listed by the
  'rvm notes' command. If you have not yet done that do so then run
  'rvm remove X ; rvm install X' where X is the ruby that you are concerned with.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm pkg install readline
    $ rvm remove 1.9.2
    $ rvm install 1.9.2 --with-readline-dir=$rvm_path/usr
%p
  Note that this error occurs most often when having a macports installed readline on your system.
  The next most often is when the readline development headers are not available at all. The above
  commands solve this by having rvm compile a local version inside ~/.rvm/usr and then telling the ruby
  install to use it.
%p
  If you have already installed your Ruby then you can manually recompile readline
  as follows. Be sure to first install the readline development headers and/or
  package as above. For example with 1.9.2-p0 and system readline development
  headers installed do the following.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ cd $HOME/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p0/ext/readline
    $ ruby extconf.rb
    $ make install

%p
  If you used 'rvm pkg install readline' then alter the above to:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ cd $HOME/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p0/ext/readline
    $ ruby extconf.rb -- --with-readline-dir="$HOME/.rvm/usr"
    $ make install
%p
  If you would like to automatically use the RVM default you can override config/db
  ruby configure setting in user/db like this:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    # ~/.rvm/user/db or /usr/local/rvm/user/db
    ruby_configure_flags=--enable-shared --disable-install-doc --with-readline-dir=/Users/wayneeseguin/.rvm/usr
