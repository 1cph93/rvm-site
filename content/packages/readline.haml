  If you have an error when compiling pertaining to readline, you may need to attempt installing with the following configure option:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm package install readline
    $ rvm remove 1.9.2
    $ rvm install 1.9.2 --with-readline-dir=$rvm_path/usr
%p
  Note that this error occurs most often when having a macports installed readline on your system.
  The next most often is when the readline development headers are not available at all. The above
  commands solve this by having rvm compile a local version inside ~/.rvm/usr and then telling the ruby
  install to use it.
%p
  If you have already installed your Ruby then you can manually recompile readline
  as follows. Be sure to first install the readline development headers and/or
  package as above. For example with 1.9.2-p0 and system readline development
  headers installed do the following.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ cd $HOME/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p0/ext/readline
    $ ruby extconf.rb
    $ make install

%p
  If you used 'rvm package install readline' then alter the above to:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ cd $HOME/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p0/ext/readline
    $ ruby extconf.rb -- --with-readline-dir="$HOME/.rvm/usr"
    $ make install
