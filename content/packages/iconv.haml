  require "iconv" # => false ?!

  If you have issues with iconv not being available in ruby / irb please try install the ruby you want with the procedure explained below.
%p
  NOTE: Before you follow the procedure below please be sure to verify that you
  have installed any dependencies for the ruby you are installing listed by the
  'rvm notes' command. If you have not yet done that do so then run

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm package install iconv
    $ rvm remove 1.9.2
    $ rvm install 1.9.2 --with-iconv-dir=$rvm_path/usr

%p
  This effectively installs a fresh copy of iconv, sandboxed to the ~/.rvm/usr directory, and tells
  ruby to use it during the compile.
