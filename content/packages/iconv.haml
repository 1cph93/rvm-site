  Quick fix
%p
  Update RVM:
  = sh_cmd "rvm get head"
  Remove all the manually installed packages:
  = sh_cmd "rvm pkg remove"
  Install the required libraries:
  = sh_cmd "rvm requirements run"
  Reinstall ruby:
  = sh_cmd "rvm reinstall 1.9.3"

%h2

%h2
  require "iconv" # => false ?!
%p
  If you have issues with iconv not being available in ruby / irb please try install the ruby you want with the procedure explained below.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm pkg install iconv
    $ rvm reinstall 1.9.2 --with-iconv-dir=$rvm_path/usr

%p
  This effectively installs a fresh copy of iconv, sandboxed to the ~/.rvm/usr directory, and tells
  ruby to use it during the compile.

%p
  In case of compilation problems try:
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      $ rvm --skip-autoreconf pkg install iconv
