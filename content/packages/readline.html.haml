  Readline
%p
  If you have an error when compiling pertaining to readline, you may need to attempt installing with the following configure option:
  %br
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      ∴ rvm package install readline
      ∴ rvm remove 1.9.1
      ∴ rvm install 1.9.1 -C --with-readline-dir=$rvm_path/usr
%p
  Note that this error occurs most often when having a macports installed readline along your path.
  Next most often is when the readline development headers are not available in your path.
%p
  If you simply cannot seem to get this to work you can have RVM install a copy of readline into ~/.rvm/usr like so:
  %br
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      ∴ rvm package install readline
      ∴ rvm remove 1.9.1
      ∴ rvm install 1.9.1
