  OpenSSL

%p
  Common issues that point to an issue with an MRI Ruby compiling openssl are:

%ul
  %li
    require "openssl" # => false ?!
  %li
    Error compiling openssl due to openssl version 1.0.0* installed on the system.

%p
  If you have issues with openssl not being available in ruby / irb please try the following configure option:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ rvm remove 1.9.2 # This ensures that you will not have any leftovers from the last run
    ∴ rvm install 1.9.2 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local

%p
  Where you replace '/usr/local' with the prefix where your openssl packages are.

%p
  If you simply cannot seem to get this to work you can have RVM install a copy of openssl into ~/.rvm/usr like so:
  %br
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      ∴ rvm package install openssl
      ∴ rvm remove 1.9.2
      ∴ rvm install 1.9.2 --with-openssl-dir=$rvm_path/usr

%p
  If you see readline errors in the make.error.log

    visit the readline page
  also.
