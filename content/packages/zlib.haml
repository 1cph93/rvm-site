    Zlib
  %hr

%h2
  Zlib

%h2
  require "zlib" # => false ?!
%p
  If you have issues with zlib not being available in ruby / irb please try the procedure defined below.
%p
  NOTE: Before you follow the procedure below please be sure to verify that you
  have installed any dependencies for the ruby you are installing listed by the
  'rvm notes' command. If you have not yet done that do so then run
  'rvm remove X ; rvm install X' where X is the ruby that you are concerned with.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm package install zlib
    $ rvm remove 1.9.2
    $ rvm install 1.9.2 --with-zlib-dir=$rvm_path/usr
%p
  Where you replace '/usr/local' with the prefix where your zlib packages are.
%p
  If you can not seem to get this to work you can have RVM install a copy of zlib into ~/.rvm/usr like so:
  %br
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      $ rvm package install zlib
      $ rvm remove 1.9.2
      $ rvm install 1.9.2
