  Who Funds RVM?
%p
  The vast majority of RVM development, including speaking about it at events, 
  has happened on my own personal time and budget.
%p
  That said, there is a 
  %a{:href => "http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/credits/donations/"}
    growing list of awesome people 
  who have donated to the project!
%p
  We also have two 'official sponsors', 
  %ul
    %li

      donates a VPS to run RVM's website on.
