%h1 Installing RVM
%p
  There are two very different ways to install/use RVM.
%ul
  %li
    As a User
  %li
    As Root
    ( be *very* sure you know what you are doing... )
  %p
    Don't forget to set your
    %a{:href => "/rubies/default/"} default ruby
    after you install so that your command line opens with ruby enabled.

%a{ :name => "install" }

  1. Installing from GitHub
%p
  There are at least 3 ways to install RVM.
%h2
  Github Repository (recommended)
%p
  To install / update from the github repository (recommended):
%pre.code
  :preserve
    bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )
%p
  What this script essentially does is the following, with some extra checks and tweaks:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    mkdir -p ~/.rvm/src/ && cd ~/.rvm/src && rm -rf ./rvm/ && git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm.git && cd rvm && ./install
%p
  Note that if you are behind a firewall (slower, but it should work), change the git:// to http:// like this:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    mkdir -p ~/.rvm/src/ && cd ~/.rvm/src && rm -rf ./rvm/ && git clone --depth 1 http://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm.git && cd rvm && ./install

%h2
  2. Installing / updating the latest rvm from the latest source tarball
%pre.code
  :preserve
    bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-latest )
%p
  What this script essentially does is the following, with some extra checks and tweaks:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    version=$(curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/stable-version.txt);
    mkdir -p ~/.rvm/src/ && cd ~/.rvm/src/ && curl -O http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-${version}.tar.gz | tar zxf - && cd rvm-${version} && ./install

%h2
  3. Installing from a gem (not recommended)
%p
  First install the gem. After the gem has installed run the rvm-install script.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ gem install rvm            # Install the RVM gem
    ∴ rvm-install                # Install RVM, adds hooks for bash & zsh
%p
  If rvm-install is not found it is likely because your users gem home is not in your path. You can add it to your path by putting this in your ~/.bashrc &amp; ~/.bash_profile
  For example my system ruby installs gems to ~/.gem/ruby/1.8 (you can see this via the 'gem env gemdir' command) so I would do:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ cat ~/.bash_profile | grep PATH
    PATH=$PATH:~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin ; export $PATH

%h1
  Post Install 
%p
  Only necessary the first time, put the following line into your profile at the very end, after all path loads etc...
%pre.code
  :preserve
    if [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]]  ; then source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ; fi
%p
  Then load the new code into your current shell and start using RVM ! w00t!
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm 

%p
  Be sure to install any dependencies for your operating system.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ rvm notes

%pre.code
  :preserve
    export PATH="$PATH:~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin"
    rvm-install
%p
  Now add the sourcing line to your profiles:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    for profile in .bash_profile .bashrc ; do echo 'if [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]]  ; then source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ; fi' >> $HOME/$profile done

%h3
  NOTE
%p
  Alternatively you can call it manually:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ ~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin/rvm-install
    (rvm installs :) )

%h1 Bootstrap script
%p
  The following script will boostrap git + RVM assuming that you have curl & sudo installed.
  It will also install (last line) several common rubies.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # Install git
    mkdir -p $HOME/.rvm/src && cd $HOME/.rvm/src && package = git && version=1.6.5.3
    curl -O http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/$package-$version.tar.gz
    cd $package-$version && ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make && sudo make install

    # Install RVM
    bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )

    # Install some rubies
    source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm
    rvm install ree,1.9.2-head,jruby

%h1 Notes & Warnings
%ul
  %li Do NOT 'return' from inside the .bashrc file or else RVM will be prevented from working properly.
  %li Be sure that scripts/rvm is sourced at the end of your profiles, after any PATH or other environmental settings.
