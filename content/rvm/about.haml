  About RVM by Wayne E. Seguin
%p
  Ruby enVironment (Version) Manager (RVM) was originally started in October of 2007.
  Back then I had the idea and enthusiastically gave it a shot.
  I became discouraged as it is a very difficult problem space.

%p
  Since then, I have gained considerable experience programming in Bash, Ruby, and other languages.
  I, at last, found myself having the proper need, skill, and desire to make RVM happen. As you can see, I did!

%p
  RVM started as a personal project, however it <i>very</i> quickly ballooned into a
  feature rich application thanks to the awesome Ruby community giving constant feedback!
