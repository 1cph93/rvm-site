  About RVM
%p
  Ruby enVironment (Version) Manager (RVM) was originally started in October of 2007, almost three years ago.
  Back then I had the idea and enthusiastically gave it a shot.
  I became discouraged as it is a very difficult problem space.
%p
  Since then, I have had much experience programming in bash, Ruby and other languages.
  I finally found myself at last having the proper need, skill and desire in order to make RVM happen.
%p
  RVM started as a personal project however it *very* quickly ballooned into a very feature rich application thanks to the awesome Ruby community giving constant feedback!
