  If you are running on a

    Darwin Based System (e.g. OSX)
  you can run:

%h2 Snow Leopard: Forcing specific architecture builds

%p
  If you want to specifically build an i386 version of ruby, you need to use
  environment variables and a patch. Snow Leopard defaults to building x86_64
  when the system determines it.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm_archflags="-arch i386" CFLAGS="-arch i386" LDFLAGS="-arch i386" rvm install 1.8.7 --patch osx-arch-fix

%p
  To set the default architecture, see
  %a{:href => "/workflow/rvmrc/"} the rvmrc page
  which explains the available variables.

%p
  If you with to build a fat binary (with support for i386 and x86_64),
  pass the --with-arch flag as follows:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm install ruby-1.9.2-head -C --with-arch=x86_64,i386

%h2
  OS X - RVM Group Membership Management
%p
  With Multi-User installations, the RVM installer automatically creates an 'rvm' group which, as the RVM documentation explains, administrators must add the users they wish to let use the RVM installation to. The call is made in the installer as:
  
%pre.code
  :preserve
    sudo dscl . -create /Groups/$rvm_group_name gid $gid

wherein RVM creates the gid by checking for the last assigned gid and adding 1. To physicially add a user to the group, administrators must use:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    sudo dscl localhost -append /Local/Default/Groups/rvm GroupMembership $user_name

Afterwards, should administrators wish to remove users from the group, they would execute:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    sudo dscl localhost -delete /Local/Default/Groups/rvm GroupMembership $user_name
    sudo dsmemberutil flushcache

This will keep the 'rvm' group, but remove the listed user from it. They can directly delete the rvm group with:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/rvm && sudo dsmemberutil flushcache

without previously deleting users from the group, as well. This will completely remove the 'rvm' group from the system.

Please note, the call to

%pre.code
  :preserve
    dsmemberutil flushcache

is required on both removal of the user from the group, and/or removal of the group directly because that membership is still cached locally until either reboot or sync with Directory Services. 

%p
  Allowing the group membership to stay in the user's 'groups' output does not mean the user is automatically re-added to the 'rvm' group should the group be subsequently be re-added. This means the user(s) end up erroneously showing they are part of the 'rvm' group even though they actually are not, if the call to 'dsmemberutil' is not made. By this we mean the 'groups' command will still show them a part of the 'rvm' group, even if the user logs out and then back in, due to caching. This applies to Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard, and Lion. Previous versions of the OS such as Cheetah/Puma, and Jaguar used 'nicl', a.k.a NetInfo, and not 'dscl'.
