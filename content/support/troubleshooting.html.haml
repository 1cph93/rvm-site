%h1
  Troubleshooting
%p
  Here we will explore common issues and their resolutions.
  Visit me (wayneeseguin) in #rvm on irc.freenode.net and let me help you with any issues and please leave feedback!
%h2
  Before trying any solution below
%p
  %ul
    %li
      Make sure that you are on the latest gem version (rvm update) or git HEAD (rvm update --head).
    %li
      make sure that the sourcing of the rvm file occurs *last* in your profile files (.bash_profile / .bashrc / .zshrc) essentially after any customizations of PATH / functions or aliases.
    %li
      Be sure to be using either bash or zsh, rvm (latest versions preferred) is untested at best in other shells.

%a{:href => "#", :name => "mysql"}
%h2
  MySQL
%p
  If you are having issues installing MySQL gem for a ruby please visit the
  %a{:href => "/passenger"}
    MySQL page.

%a{:href => "#", :name => "passenger"}
%h2
  Passenger
%p
  If you are having issues getting passenger running with an rvm installed ruby, most likely you missed the '.bin/[ruby string]' comment on the
  %a{:href => "/passenger"}
    passenger page.

%a{:href => "#", :name => "readline"}
%h2
  Readline
%p
  If you have an error when compiling pertaining to readline, you may need to attempt installing with the following configure option:
  %br
  %pre.code
    :preserve
    rvm install readline ; rvm remove 1.9.1 ; rvm install 1.9.1 -C --with-readline-dir=$rvm_path/usr
%p
  Note that this error occurs most often when having a macports installed readline along your path.
  Next most often is when the readline development headers are not available in your path.
%p
  If you simply cannot seem to get this to work you can have rvm install a copy of readline into ~/.rvm/usr like so:
  %br
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      rvm install readline
      rvm remove 1.9.1 ; rvm install 1.9.1
%p
  Be sure you are on either rvm git head or release 0.0.78+ as it has some essential bug fixes for this to work properly.
%p
  Then

%a{:href => "#", :name => "iconv"}
%h2
  require "iconv" # => false ?!
%p
  If you have issues with iconv not being available in ruby / irb please try the following configure option:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    rvm install iconv ; rvm remove 1.9.1 ; rvm install 1.9.1 -C --with-iconv-dir=$rvm_path/usr
%p
  Where you replace '/usr/local' with the prefix where your iconv libraries are. (Thanks to Justin Chen for bringing this doosey to our attention!)
%p
  If you simply cannot seem to get this to work you can have rvm install a copy of readline into ~/.rvm/usr like so:
  %br
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      rvm install iconv
      rvm remove 1.9.1 ; rvm install 1.9.1
%p
  Be sure you are on either rvm git head or release 0.0.78+ as it has some essential bug fixes for this to work properly.

%a{:href => "#", :name => "curl"}
%h2
  curl failing, 'curl is' ?!
%p
  If you see this:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ++ curl is /opt/local/bin/curl -O -L -s -C - ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6-p383.tar.gz
    curl: Remote file name has no length!
    curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information
%p
  Then maybe you have aliased or symlinked the 'which' command to the 'type' command, revert this and rvm should work.

%a{:href => "#", :name => "pg"}
%h2
  I can't seem to install the pg gem.
%p
  Prepend with a variable assignment for PATH with the location of the pg_config file, for example:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    PATH=/Users/wayne/.dbm/postgresql-8.4.0/bin:$PATH gem install pg --no-rdoc --no-ri
