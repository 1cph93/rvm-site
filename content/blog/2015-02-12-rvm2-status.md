# RVM 2 in progress

TL;DR: Do you want `RVM 2`? - help with maintaining `RVM 1`.

<!-- more -->

`RVM 2` is still in development, but to finish it I (Michal Papis) need
to stop spending to much time supporting `RVM 1`.

It lays in my nature to help people, it makes me happy and I can not
stop helping. As much great it might sound it is holding me down,
any time I try to start working on `RVM 2` I get tickets or questions
for `RVM 1`. With the constant switching it started to take tool on both
projects. `RVM 2` got pushed away as the tickets for `RVM 1` were
"important enough" - and `RVM 1` is frozen for big changes because new
code is supposed to be written for `RVM 2`.

## RVM 1 needs more maintainers

I got stack in this situation and it took me some time to realize I need
help with maintaining `RVM 1` to get the time to finish `RVM 2`. I'm
asking the RVM users to consider helping me out with maintaining
`RVM 1`. Every week `RVM 1` gets multiple tickets, they all need
reading, testing, response ... handling those tickets takes time, I need
help with that. Less often new rubies and new operating systems are
released, this requires testing, building new binaries, releasing
versions. New and inexperienced users ask questions on IRC, twitter,
stack overflow - it all requires handling.

**I'm looking for people willing to help with handling tickets, building
binaries, supporting the community, if you are interested please mail me
at [mpapis@gmail.com](mailto:mpapis@gmail.com)**.

## RVM 2 continues

Getting help in supporting `RVM 1` would allow me to focus on `RVM 2`,
I still have founds to work on `2` for half year and getting
uninterrupted time for it I will be able to finalize it.
So please help if you can.

Also please Spread the word, if you know someone interested in open
source with a little time to spare just let them know about `RVM 1`.
