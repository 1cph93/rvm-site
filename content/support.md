## Help & Support

If you are new to RVM and need help, please join #rvm on irc.freenode.net which is explained on
the IRC page linked to below. Leave a message for me there, and stay connected or check back as I
will respond as soon as I have a chance. Don't just wait for me though, there are plenty
of knowledgeable users in the channel willing to help.

If you are an experienced RVM user, and have what you can show in a gist as a bug, then please chat
with me in #rvm and file an issue on github for it as well.

NOTE: Please be sure to view the CLOSED issues as well, a great many issues have been solved
previously and the solution (bug fix or configuration changes) posted in the Issue. In most cases,
a link is provided to the closing repository commit. We ask this because we get a LOT of duplicate
Issues filed, and this allows us to properly triage Issues. Thank you!
