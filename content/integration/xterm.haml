%h1 Integrating rvm with xterm

%p
  If you are going to use multi-user rvm installation with xterm, you'll probably need to change it's default options.

%p
  Multi-user rvm creates a script in /etc/profile.d, which is being sourced on startup. By default, xterm runs bash as usual, non-login shell, therefore skipping /etc/profile* and executing only ~/.bashrc

%p 
  For rvm to work properly, you have to set 'loginShell true' in your \$HOME/.xtermrc file, or execute 'xterm -ls' which makes xterm launch as a login shell.
