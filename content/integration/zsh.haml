  RVM requires :
  %ul
    %li
      The use of globs that can possible be empty (no matches).
      If you experience glob problems try setting 'setopt nullglob' in your zsh profiles.

      Shell regex support via the operator =~.  =~ appeared first in 4.3.5,(it was added in
      %a{:href => "http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2007/msg00296.html"}
        zsh-workers-23375.
      )

  how can I tell if my version of zsh supports =~ ?

%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ foo=baaaar; [[ $foo =~ ba*r ]] && echo "Your shell supports the =~ regex operator." || echo "Your shell does not support the =~ regex operator."
    Your shell supports the =~ regex operator.
    ∴ zsh --version
    zsh 4.3.5

%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ foo=baaaar; [[ $foo =~ ba*r ]] && echo "Your shell supports the =~ regex operator." || echo "I like sheep, they are soft and fluffy..."
    zsh: condition expected: =~
    ∴ zsh --version
    zsh 4.3.4

%p
  How can I upgrade my zsh version?

%pre.code
  :preserve
    version="4.3.10" ; mkdir -p ~/.src && cd ~/.src && curl -O -L --create-dirs -C - http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/zsh/zsh-dev/$version/zsh-$version.tar.bz2?use_mirror=voxel && tar jxf zsh-$version.tar.bz2* && cd zsh-$version && ./configure --prefix=/ && make && sudo make install

  If you're using zsh (possibly with oh-my-zsh) and your prompt displays the current directory as "~rvm_rvmrc_cwd",
  the fix is relatively simple. Simply add the following to your shell file before sourcing rvm:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    unsetopt auto_name_dirs
