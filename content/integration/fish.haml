    Fish Shell
  %hr

%h2
  Fish Shell

%p
  Since rvm is a large collection of bash scripts and fish is not bash-compatible,
  users of fish need a wrapper around rvm to make it work properly with that shell.
  Since rvm just manipulates environment variables, we just need a way to preserve
  those changes.
 
%h2 Install
%p
  Install rvm [as you would for use with bash](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/).
  When running the `rvm-install` command, feel free to ignore the advice under the
  "You must now finish the install manually" section.
 
%h2 Setup
%p 
  Download the fish functions from GitHub, the first a utility function to capture the
changes to environment variables, the second a wrapper around rvm for fish.
%pre.code
  :preserve
     set -l GITHUB http://github.com/eventualbuddha/fish-nuggets/raw/master/functions
     curl -o ~/.config/fish/functions/__bash_env_to_fish.fish $GITHUB/__bash_env_to_fish.fish
     curl -o ~/.config/fish/functions/rvm.fish $GITHUB/rvm.fish
 
%h2 Usage
%p
  Use rvm just as you would in bash or zsh as per the instructions on the website,
  converting any bashisms to fish as needed.
